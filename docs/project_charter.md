## Stakeholders and Expectations:

Team: receive detailed and accurate feedback on software performance

ITIS G.Marconi: Have a cool app that calculates the agricultural yield of a company

Sponsor: Get visibility with an app that entrepreneurs can use to monitor their agricultural yield

------

## Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project): 

Entrepreneurs using the FS-Agriculture application will be able to monitor the performance of their farm in real time. The user must input the data concerning the plot of land, in output he will receive the amount of cultivation that the field will be able to produce.

------

## Goals and Objectives: 
The overall goal is to provide an efficient way to keep track of the performance of your agricultural business

·  Provide a mobile interface to control and manage your farm

· It works in a simple and intuitive way.

Provide entrepreneurs with a real-time description of the progress of their agricultural enterprise

## Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information): 

1 project manager at 8 hours per week for 2 weeks  16 hours *  $50/hr = $800

1 requirements engineer at 8 hours per week for 2 weeks  16 hours *  $40/hr = $640

2 software engineers at 18 hours per week each for 1 month 72 hours * $40/hr = $2880 (each engineer)

176 hours total, $7200 total, avg, $42.50 per hour

------

## Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:
The dates are not flexible without the prior authorization of the sponsor. The roles can be modified and proposals for a possible modification of the working groups are accepted, the work is divided equally. It would however be preferable that the roles did not change too much during the project realization.

------

## Approach:
Each group is assigned a part of the application. The software program is divided into three main parts: the frontend containing the login form, the main database containing the data of the agricultural companies and the part relating to the data to be calculated. Each group has a team leader specialized in the part of the project to be developed.

------

## Constraints: 
Sponsor approval is required to make this app official. All symbols used in the app must comply with the guidelines provided. We are proceeding with the project while pursuing this consensus with the understanding that we may not get it. If consent is denied, the team will create an unofficial app.

------

## Assumptions: 
The sponsor's terminals are available and work when we need them. It will be possible to work in locations far from the company. You can interface the app with a third-party website.

------

## Success Criteria: 
The project will be considered a success if the team delivers an operational prototype by the set discontinuation date with the characteristics requested by the customer and if the team has managed to collaborate in an efficient and productive way.

------

## Scope:
At a minimum, the software will allow users to check and monitor the progress of their farm. Weather permitting, the scope could be extended to include additional features, such as calculating the average daily temperature for proper crop development.

------

 ## Risks  and obstacles to success: 
One risk the team faces is the lack of experience in mobile app development. We only have a better hypothesis for the level of work required for the features we are committed to. We do not yet have a clear picture of how the code will be implemented.
