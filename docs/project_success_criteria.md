# Success Criteria for SF-Agriculture



#### The fully functional test system is delivered by spring 2020.

The system must be delivered in a ready state for use in the intended production environment for the intended purpose. Users must receive the training they need to start using the system. We will consider both of these goals if users who intend to use the system during the trial period fill out the survey provided by our company.

#### The concerns raised in the trial period are addressed based on the troubleshooting plan contained in the software project management plan

All defects will be resolved. A critical flaw is a flaw for which there is no convenient solution. In addition to correcting defects, the requested changes will be managed on an escalator. Changes that require 10 hours or less will be made if notified of the change 1 weeks before the planned end of the project.

Users must be informed of their rights and responsibilities under this policy.

#### The entrepreneurs can easily log into the system.

This specifically means that a user will be able to select the access option, type their name, surname and data regarding their agricultural enterprise, select events and press a confirmation button.

#### SF-Agriculture  supervisors can edit events in the system calendar.

An official will be able to log into the system, select the calendar option and add or remove special events. In addition, this means that they will be able to check the events available for entrepreneurs' daily access.

#### SF-Agriculture supervisors can create and edit user accounts.

This includes officer, volunteer and youth accounts. All data should be editable from the Internet interface.

#### The database containing our customers' fields is updated

Data from our application's existing database is loaded into the new system. The data of all fields in the existing database must be migrated to the corresponding fields in the new database.

#### SF-Agriculture supervisors can print all the reports

These reports must be in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the data correctly displayed. The data in the report should accurately reflect what is saved on our servers.

#### The System is documented.

The user manual is included. This manual should be easy to understand for non-technical users who are familiar with the basic concepts of the Internet, the manual only explains how to use all the features of the system.

A system manual must be produced. This system manual must contain the architecture document, as well as any additional material necessary to provide a technician with all the information necessary to maintain and update the system. A single reading of this document and not more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide a suitably qualified technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes.

#### Known defects are entered into the location system

The difects detected but not immediately settled will be entered into the tracking system. At the end of the project there must be no unresolved defects.
